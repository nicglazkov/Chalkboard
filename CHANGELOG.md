# Changelog

All notable changes to Chalkboard. Newest first; the format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). `VERSION` is the single source of
truth: every change merged to main bumps it and adds an entry here
(`python scripts/bump_version.py patch "what changed"`). A running server
reports its version at `/version`.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-10-06

- Versioning: `VERSION` file, `GET /version` and `GET /api/version` (version, git commit, server uptime, runtime, config, latest changelog entry, useful endpoints), `version` in `/api/meta` and `/api/status`, `python main.py --version`, and `chalkboard_version` + `git_commit` in every run's `manifest.json` and `run_stats.json`.
- Web UI: the sidebar footer shows the running version and commit, linking to `/version`.
- CI: pull requests must bump `VERSION` and add a CHANGELOG entry; each new version on main is tagged `v<VERSION>` automatically. `scripts/bump_version.py` does the bump.
- Library: free-text notes per video, editable on the video page (#57).
- Uploads: one shared file-type list for the UI and server, folder drops, auto-growing topic box (#55).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-03

- Self-hosted revival: local Manim rendering (Docker optional), Claude Opus 5.5 by default with per-agent overrides, a design system with six scene templates, word-level narration sync, Aria and Milo on ElevenLabs plus Kokoro and OpenAI, working layout checks, a new web UI built only on live data, `run_stats.json` run records, and CI on every push.
